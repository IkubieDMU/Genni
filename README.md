# Genni App: Full Code Documentation üì±üí™

Welcome to the complete documentation for your Genni Android application! This guide will walk you through every part of the code, explaining what each piece does and how it contributes to the overall app experience. Let's get started!

---

## 1. üè† Core Application Setup

This section covers the foundational parts of your app, including where it starts and how it navigates between different sections.

### 1.1. `MainActivity.kt` - The App's Launchpad üöÄ

This is the very first file that runs when your app starts. It's like the main control center!

* **`onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?)`**:
    * `enableEdgeToEdge()`: Makes your app's content stretch nicely across the whole screen, even under the status bar and navigation bar. Super immersive! üì±‚ú®
    * `setContent { ... }`: This is where your entire Jetpack Compose UI is built. Think of it as the canvas for your app's look and feel. üé®
    * `GenniTheme { App() }`: Applies your custom Genni design theme to everything and then calls the `App()` function to set up the rest of the application.

* **`App()` Composable**:
    * **`rememberNavController()`**: This is your app's navigator! It helps you move between different screens and keeps track of where you've been (the "back stack"). üó∫Ô∏è
    * **ViewModel Initialization**: You'll see a bunch of `remember { ... ViewModel() }` lines. These create and hold onto your app's "brains" (ViewModels) that manage data and logic for different parts of the app. They stick around even when screens change! üß†üí°
        * `UserViewModel`, `AuthViewModel`, `WorkoutViewModel`, `AppSettingsViewModel`, `AdminViewModel`, `HomeViewModel`, `HCViewModel`, `ForgetPasswordViewModel`, `BEViewModel`.
    * **`GenniTheme(darkTheme = isDarkTheme)`**: The app's overall look (light or dark mode) is set here, based on user preferences. üåì
    * **`NavHost(...) { ... }`**: This defines all the possible paths and destinations within your app.
        * `startDestination = Screens.LoginScreen.screen`: When the app first opens, it always lands on the login screen. ‚û°Ô∏è
        * **`composable(Screens.ScreenName.screen) { ScreenComposable(...) }`**: Each `composable` block maps a specific route (like "loginscreen") to a Composable function (like `LoginScreen`). This is how your navigator knows which UI to show for each path! ‚úÖ

### 1.2. `Screens.kt` - The App's Map üó∫Ô∏èüìå

This file contains a special type of class called a `sealed class` that lists *all* the possible screens in your app. It's like a table of contents for your navigation!

* **`sealed class Screens(val screen: String)`**:
    * This class ensures that only the screens you define can exist. It makes your navigation safe and easy to manage, preventing typos in screen names. üîí
    * **`data object LoginScreen:Screens("loginscreen")`**: Each line here is a unique screen, with a clear name (e.g., `LoginScreen`) and a unique string identifier (e.g., `"loginscreen"`) that the `NavController` uses.
    * You have routes for:
        * Authentication: `LoginScreen`, `SignUpScreen`, `ForgetPasswordScreen`, `FPContdScreen` üîê
        * Main Features: `HomeScreen`, `GeneratedWorkoutScreen`, `WorkoutSimulatorScreen`, `SavedWorkoutScreen` üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
        * Health Tools: `HealthCalculationsScreen`, `HCExplanationScreen`, `FoodRecommScreen` ‚ù§Ô∏è
        * Mindfulness: `BreathingExercisesScreen`, `BreathingExercisesSimulatorScreen` üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
        * User & App Info: `SettingsScreen`, `AboutScreen`, `ProfileScreen` ‚öôÔ∏è
        * Admin Features: `AdminHomeScreen`, `AdminLoginScreen`, `AdminSignUpScreen` üëë

---

## 2. üß© Reusable UI Components (Composables)

These are small, independent building blocks that you can use across many different screens to keep your UI consistent and your code clean!

### 2.1. Input Fields (`MyCustomTF`, `MyCustomPasswordTF`) ‚å®Ô∏è

These are custom text input fields with a consistent look and feel.

* **`MyCustomTF(value, updatedValue, labelText, leading_Icon, iconDesc, isError)`**:
    * **Purpose:** A general-purpose text input field. üìù
    * **Features:**
        * **`value` & `updatedValue`**: Holds the text and updates it when you type.
        * **`labelText`**: The hint text that floats when you type. üè∑Ô∏è
        * **`leading_Icon`**: An icon at the start of the text field (e.g., a person icon for username). üñºÔ∏è
        * **`isError`**: If `true`, the field turns red to show an error. üö´
        * **Styling**: Has rounded corners, transparent background, and custom colors for icons, labels, and text, making it look sleek! üé®

* **`MyCustomPasswordTF(value, updatedValue, labelText, leading_Icon, iconDesc, isError)`**:
    * **Purpose:** Specifically for password input. üîë
    * **Features:** All the good stuff from `MyCustomTF`, plus:
        * **Password Visibility Toggle:** A little eye icon at the end that you can tap to show or hide the password characters. Super handy for security and usability! üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è

### 2.2. `ClickableText` - Tappable Text üëÜ

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ClickableText(text: String, color: Color, fontsize: TextUnit, onClick: () -> Unit) {
    Text(
        text,
        color = color,
        fontSize = fontsize,
        modifier = Modifier.clickable{ onClick() }
    )
}
```

* **Purpose:** Makes any piece of text tappable, turning it into a clickable link or button. üîó
* **How it works:** You give it some `text`, a `color`, a `fontsize`, and a special `onClick` action that happens when the user taps it.

### 2.3. `InfoRow` - Displaying Information Neatly üìä

```kotlin
@Composable
fun InfoRow(label: String, value: String) {
    Column(
        modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth().padding(vertical = 6.dp).background(Color.White.copy(alpha = 0.05f), shape = RoundedCornerShape(12.dp)).padding(12.dp)
    ) {
        Text(text = label, color = Color.White.copy(alpha = 0.6f), fontSize = 14.sp)
        Text(text = value, color = Color.White, fontSize = 16.sp, fontWeight = FontWeight.SemiBold)
    }
}
```

* **Purpose:** Presents a label and its corresponding value in a clean, organized row. Perfect for profile details or health metrics. üìù
* **Styling:** Each `InfoRow` has a slightly transparent white background with rounded corners, making individual pieces of information stand out nicely. ‚ú®

### 2.4. `SettingToggle` - On/Off Switches üîõ

```kotlin
@Composable
fun SettingToggle(label: String, state: Boolean, onToggle: (Boolean) -> Unit) {
    Row(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxWidth()
            .padding(vertical = 12.dp)
            .background(Color.White.copy(alpha = 0.05f), RoundedCornerShape(12.dp))
            .padding(horizontal = 16.dp, vertical = 12.dp),
        verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically,
        horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.SpaceBetween
    ) {
        Text(label, color = Color.White, fontSize = 16.sp)
        Switch(checked = state, onCheckedChange = onToggle, colors = SwitchDefaults.colors(checkedThumbColor = emeraldGreen))
    }
}
```

* **Purpose:** A reusable component for creating toggle switches for app settings. ‚öôÔ∏è
* **Features:** Displays a `label` (e.g., "Dark Mode") and a `Switch` that reflects the current `state` (on/off). When toggled, it calls `onToggle` to update the setting.

### 2.5. `WorkoutBox` - Interactive Workout Category Boxes üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

```kotlin
@Composable
fun WorkoutBox(title: String, onClick: () -> Unit) {
    Box(
        contentAlignment = Alignment.Center,
        modifier = Modifier
            .size(160.dp)
            .clip(RoundedCornerShape(20.dp))
            .background(Brush.verticalGradient(listOf(Color.White.copy(alpha = 0.15f), Color.White.copy(alpha = 0.05f))))
            .border(1.dp, Color.White.copy(alpha = 0.3f), RoundedCornerShape(20.dp))
            .clickable { onClick() }
    ) {
        Text(title, color = Color.White, fontSize = 18.sp, fontWeight = FontWeight.Bold, textAlign = TextAlign.Center, modifier = Modifier.padding(8.dp))
    }
}
```

* **Purpose:** Used on the `HomeScreen` to represent different workout customization options (e.g., "Muscle Groups").
* **Features:** These are square boxes with a `title`, a subtle gradient background, a white border, and rounded corners. They are `clickable` to open a bottom sheet for selection. ‚ú®

### 2.6. `PlayButton` & `StartButton` - Action Triggers ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

These are large, visually appealing buttons to start workouts or breathing sessions.

* **`PlayButton(context, navController, workouts)` (in `GeneratedWorkoutScreen`)**:
    * **Purpose:** Starts the generated workout session. üöÄ
    * **Features:** A large, circular `IconButton` with a gradient background and a white border. It has a `PlayArrow` icon. Tapping it navigates to the `WorkoutSimulatorScreen` if there are workouts available.
* **`StartButton(context, navController)` (in `BreathingExercisesScreen`)**:
    * **Purpose:** Starts the breathing exercise session. üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
    * **Features:** Very similar to `PlayButton`, it's a large, circular `IconButton` that navigates to the `BreathingExercisesSimulatorScreen`.

### 2.7. `DropdownMenuDurationSelector` - Time Selection ‚è∞

```kotlin
@Composable
fun DropdownMenuDurationSelector(selectedDuration: Int, onDurationSelected: (Int) -> Unit) {
    var expanded by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
    val options = (5..10).toList()

    Box {
        Button(onClick = { expanded = true }) {
            Text("$selectedDuration min")
        }
        DropdownMenu(expanded = expanded, onDismissRequest = { expanded = false }) {
            options.forEach { duration ->
                DropdownMenuItem(
                    text = { Text("$duration minutes") },
                    onClick = {
                        onDurationSelected(duration)
                        expanded = false
                    }
                )
            }
        }
    }
}
```

* **Purpose:** Allows users to select a duration (e.g., for breathing exercises) from a dropdown menu.
* **Features:** Displays a button showing the `selectedDuration`. When clicked, a `DropdownMenu` appears with options (5 to 10 minutes). Selecting an option updates the `selectedDuration`.
