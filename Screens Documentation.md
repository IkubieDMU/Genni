## Screen Documentation 🚀

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the screen-related Kotlin files within the Genni application, highlighting their purpose, key features, and interactions. Genni is a health and fitness application with diverse functionalities, all built using Jetpack Compose.

### Core Application Flow & Navigation 🗺️

* **`MainActivity.kt`**: This is the heart ❤️ of the Genni application. It serves as the main activity that initializes the Jetpack Compose UI and sets up the `NavHost` for navigating between all the different screens. It orchestrates the flow by defining routes for user authentication, home features, health calculations, workout simulations, breathing exercises, and settings. ViewModels like `AuthViewModel`, `HomeViewModel`, `WorkoutViewModel`, `HCViewModel`, `BEViewModel`, `ForgetPasswordViewModel`, `UserViewModel`, `AppSettingsViewModel`, and `AdminViewModel` are initialized here, enabling data sharing and state management across the app.
* **`Screens.kt`**: This crucial file acts as a central registry for all navigation routes within the Genni app 🧭. It defines a `sealed class Screens` with `data object` declarations for each distinct screen, providing a consistent and type-safe way to refer to navigation destinations (e.g., `LoginScreen`, `HomeScreen`, `WorkoutSimulatorScreen`). This makes navigation clean and organized throughout the application.

### User Authentication & Profile Management 🔐

* **`Login.kt`**: This file powers the secure login experience for users 🛡️. It presents a Composable UI where users can input their email and password. It integrates with an `AuthViewModel` to handle authentication logic, display loading indicators ⏳, and provide feedback (success/error messages) using Android Toasts. From here, users can navigate to the Sign Up screen or, if implemented, the Admin Login screen.
* **`SignUp.kt`**: This screen is where new users embark on their Genni journey 📝. It's a comprehensive form allowing users to register with details like first name, middle name, last name, age, gender, fitness goals, years of training, username, password, email, weight, height, and even a profile picture 📸. It includes validation for password strength and email format and uses a `UserViewModel` to register the new user, providing immediate feedback and navigating back to the Login screen upon successful registration.
* **`ForgotPassword.kt`**: This screen initiates the password reset process 📧. It provides a UI for users to enter their email address to receive a password reset link or code. It manages the UI state (loading, success, error) and navigates the user to the `FPContdScreen` upon successful initiation of the reset process.
* **`FPContd.kt`**: This file implements the second part of the "Forgot Password" flow 🔄. Here, users can input and confirm a new password. It includes robust validation to ensure the new password meets security requirements (e.g., minimum length, uppercase letter, symbol) and matches the confirmation. Upon successful password update, it guides the user back to the `LoginScreen`.
* **`Profile.kt`**: This screen is the user's personal dashboard within Genni 👤. It prominently displays the user's name, email, and profile picture, if available. Below that, it provides a detailed overview of their personal and health-related information, including age, gender, height, weight, years of training, and fitness goals. This centralizes all key user data for easy reference.

### Health & Wellness Features 🍎💪

* **`HealthCalculations.kt`**: This screen is dedicated to all things health metrics! 📊 It calculates and displays important health indicators such as Body Mass Index (BMI), Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), Body Fat Percentage (BFP), and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). It uses `HCViewModel` and `AuthViewModel` to fetch user data and display personalized results, often with visual cues (like color-coded statuses) for easy understanding of health status.
* **`HCExplanation.kt`**: This screen provides in-depth explanations and personalized recommendations based on the user's health calculations 🧠. It delves into the meaning of BMI, BFP, and BMR, and offers tailored advice, including detailed protein intake breakdowns for different meals 🍳🥗🍲🥤 and daily water intake goals 💧. It emphasizes practical tips for health improvement.
* **`FoodRecomm.kt`**: Get ready for personalized meal suggestions! 🍽️ This file displays food recommendations categorized by fitness goals (e.g., Muscle Gain, Weight Loss) based on the user's BMI and BFP. Each food item is listed with its calorie and protein content, helping users make informed dietary choices.
* **`BreathingExercises.kt`**: This screen is your gateway to mindful breathing 🌬️. It lists various breathing exercise patterns, each detailing the inhale, hold, and exhale durations. Users can select an exercise and launch into a dedicated simulator to practice, promoting relaxation and focus.
* **`BESimulatorScreen.kt`**: This is the interactive simulator for breathing exercises 🧘. It visually guides the user through each phase (inhale, hold, exhale) with a progress indicator or timer, allowing them to follow the rhythm of the exercise. Users can pause and resume their session, providing a flexible and supportive environment for practice.

### Workout & Training Modules 🏋️‍♀️🏃‍♂️

* **`Home.kt`**: Beyond navigation, the Home screen is where users kickstart their fitness journey ✨. It allows users to generate customized workouts by selecting muscle groups, desired sets/reps, available equipment, and workout duration. It leverages `HomeViewModel`, `AuthViewModel`, and `WorkoutViewModel` to manage user preferences and initiate workout generation.
* **`GeneratedWorkout.kt`**: After setting preferences, this screen proudly presents the user with their newly generated workout plan! 🎉 It displays a comprehensive list of exercises, including their name, sets, reps, duration, and equipment needed. Users can view workout details and initiate the `WorkoutSimulatorScreen` directly from here.
* **`WorkoutSimulatorScreen.kt`**: This is where the magic of working out happens! 🤸‍♀️ This screen provides a dynamic interface for users to follow their generated workout. It displays the current exercise, manages the workout timer, and offers controls to pause, resume, or skip exercises. It integrates with a `WorkoutViewModel` to track progress and manage the workout session state.
* **`SavedWorkouts.kt`**: Don't lose track of your progress! 📚 This screen allows users to view and manage their previously saved workout routines. It presents a list of saved workouts, typically showing the workout name and the date it was saved, providing a history of their fitness journey.
* **`UploadWorkouts.kt`**: This file appears to be a tool for populating the application with default workout data 🛠️. It contains a `UploadWorkoutScreen` Composable that, although commented out in the provided snippet, likely has the functionality to trigger the upload of default workouts to a backend system (e.g., Firebase) via the `WorkoutViewModel`. This screen is probably for internal use or admin purposes.

### Settings & Miscellaneous ⚙️💡

* **`SettingsScreen.kt`**: This screen provides users with the ability to customize their app experience 🔧. It includes options for various settings, most notably a prominent logout button that, when pressed, securely logs the user out and navigates them back to the Login screen. It interacts with `AuthViewModel` for logout functionality and potentially `AppSettingsViewModel` for other configurable options.
* **`About.kt`**: This screen introduces users to the Genni application ✨. It displays the application logo and provides a concise description of what Genni offers, emphasizing its personalized health and fitness features. It also highlights key functionalities like AI-powered workout generation, smart timers, and goal-oriented approaches. Furthermore, it includes credits to the development team and the application's version number, promoting transparency and branding.
* **`Miscellaneous.kt`**: This file is a utility hub for reusable UI components and helper functions, rather than a standalone screen 🛠️. It contains composable functions like `CustomTextField` for consistent input fields and `ClickableText` for interactive text elements. These components are likely used across various screens to maintain a uniform design and reduce code duplication.

I hope this comprehensive documentation helps you understand the Genni application's structure and functionality! Let me know if you have any other questions. 😊
